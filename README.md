# PollBot
Discord voting bot

The bot uses emojis inorder to take votes and after the voting time period displays the winner.

Must have node installed to run the bot via >node voteBot.js or clicking on the bat file(which is really buggy, would rather >node voteBot.js).

# Commands:
!poll help

!poll title of poll|time|2|option 1|option 2|etc...

The |time|2 part is optional, it simply just sets the timer for it to end at 2 minutes. The default time is for the poll to end in 6 hours. If you would like the default time just replace time and 2 with different options.

Also make sure to update token.json with your token for your bot if you plan on replicating this.
